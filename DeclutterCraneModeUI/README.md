# Declutter Crane Mode UI

The advanced build mode is fantastic, but it has so much stuff on screen that hides your restaurant making it hard to see everything.  This mod will remove everything except your current money, so that you can clearly see your whole restaurant!

Enabling crane mode will cause the UI elements to dissapear, and they will reappear upon exiting crane mode.

This mod can optionally be enabled/disabled in the pause options menu.
