# Free Camera Control

<!-- TODO rerecord video with a different username -->

Don't like how Plate Up! is controlling the camera for you?  Are things too small and you'd like to see them zoomed in?  This mod allows you to manually control the camera yourself!  You can pan and zoom the camera to position it however you would like!

## Usage and Controller Buttons

In order to be able to control the camera you must first unlock the camera with **Right Stick Press**.

The camera can then be controlled as follows:

<table>
      <tr><td>Lock/Unlock Camera</td><td>Right Stick Press</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Pan Camera</td><td>Left Stick</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Adjust Zoom</td><td>Right Stick Y</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Center on Player</td><td>Right Shoulder Button</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Reset Camera</td><td>Left Shoulder Button</td></tr>
</table>

When you're finished adjusting the camera **Right Stick Press** and the camera will be locked again!
