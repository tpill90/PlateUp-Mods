A fixed and improved version of the [Original Paper Plates Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913800987).  It is compatible with the latest version of Plate Up!

## Description

Welcome to the environmentally irresponsible Paper Plate Mod for Plate Up! With this mod, you can now throw away traditional dishes and use disposable paper plates instead. No need to worry about washing dishes or conserving resources - just toss those paper plates in the bin when you're done.

This mod adds a new level of convenience to your gameplay, allowing you to serve your customers without the hassle of clean-up. But be warned: using paper plates may not win you any sustainability awards. In fact, it's probably a big no-no in the eyes of eco-conscious individuals. You'll see your chefs carelessly tossing dishes into the garbage, and your customers will be able to watch as the pile of paper plates grows and grows.

Overall, the paper plate mod is perfect for players who value convenience over the well-being of the planet. So if you're looking to make a big environmental impact - but not in a good way - this mod is for you!
